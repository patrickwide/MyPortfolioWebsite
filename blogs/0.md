To run the provided Python code for sending emails, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine, and you may also need to install the `smtplib` library. You can install the library using the following command:

```bash
pip install secure-smtplib
```

Additionally, the code uses the standard library modules `email.mime.text` and `email.mime.multipart`, which are included with Python, so no separate installation is required for them.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Python:** If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install the `secure-smtplib` library:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install secure-smtplib
   ```

3. **Update the code:** Replace the placeholder values in the code with your actual email addresses and password.

4. **Allow Less Secure Apps (if using Gmail):** If you are using Gmail as the email provider, you may need to allow access to less secure apps in your Google Account settings. You can do this by going to [Less secure app access](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) and turning on access.

Once you've completed these steps, you should be able to run the code to send emails. Remember that using plain passwords for email authentication is not secure. For a production environment, consider using OAuth2 authentication or other secure methods.
